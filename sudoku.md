## **Step 1 – `printBoard`**

**Purpose:** Show the Sudoku board.

**Story:**
Imagine you have a chessboard, but instead of chess pieces, you have numbers.
This function is like taking a **photo of your puzzle** and showing it to your friends.

**How it works:**

1. It looks at the board **row by row**.
2. Each row is printed like: `5 3 . . 7 . . . .`
3. Dots (`.`) mean “no number here yet”.

**Kid-picture in words:**
📷 🧒 → _(Holds up paper)_ “Look! This is what my puzzle looks like right now.”

## **Step 2 – `findEmpty`**

**Purpose:** Find the next empty square.

**Story:**
Imagine you’re looking for an **empty chair** in a classroom so you can sit down.
This function walks row by row, seat by seat, and says:
“Oh! Here’s a chair with no one sitting in it. Let’s try putting a number here!”

**How it works:**

1. It goes from top-left to bottom-right.
2. If it sees a dot (`.`), it stops and returns that position.

**Kid-picture in words:**
👀 🪑 → _(Points)_ “Aha! This chair is empty. I’ll sit here!”

## **Step 3 – `checkRC or isValid`**

**Purpose:** Check if a number can be placed in a certain spot.

**Story:**
It’s like asking: **“Can I sit here without breaking the rules?”**
Sudoku has 3 rules:

1. No same number in the same row.
2. No same number in the same column.
3. No same number in the same 3×3 box.

**How it works:**

- Checks the **row**: walks across it like a hall monitor checking lockers.
- Checks the **column**: walks down like an elevator visiting each floor.
- Checks the **3×3 grid**: looks inside a small fenced playground.

**Kid-picture in words:**
🚫❌ “Nope, you can’t sit here if your twin is already in the row, column, or playground!”

## **Step 4 – `solveSudoku`**

**Purpose:** The “brain” — tries numbers and backtracks if wrong.

**Story:**
Think of it as **trying on different hats** until you find one that fits perfectly.

**How it works:**

1. Find the next empty spot.
2. Try numbers **1 to 9**.
3. If a number is valid, **pretend it’s correct** and move on to the next empty spot.
4. If you reach the end with no mistakes → 🎉 done!
5. If you get stuck, go back (“backtrack”), erase the wrong number, and try the next one.

**Kid-picture in words:**
🧢🧢🧢 → “This hat doesn’t fit… try another… Oh! This one fits! Keep going!”

## **Step 5 – `main`**

**Purpose:** The director — sets up the puzzle, calls the solver, and shows the result.

**Story:**
Like a teacher handing you a worksheet and saying:
“Here’s your puzzle, solve it, and then show me your answers.”

**How it works:**

- Reads the puzzle from what you type in.
- Gives it to `solveSudoku`.
- Prints “Error” if the puzzle can’t be solved.
- Otherwise, shows the completed board.

**Kid-picture in words:**
👩‍🏫📝 → “Here’s your homework. Bring it back when you’re done!”
